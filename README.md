# advent-of-code-2024

All my implementations of [Avent of Code days 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024):

- [1/12](days/1/main.ts) - ⭐⭐ - compute distance and similarity between two number lists
- [2/12](days/2/main.ts) - ⭐⭐ - count safe or dampened safe report in a list of them (a report is a number list)
- [3/12](days/3/main.ts) - ⭐⭐ - parse a text file to extract well-formatted multiplication operations and sum their results (can have do/don't rules)

## Commands

To run it:

```sh
deno task aoc ${day}
```
