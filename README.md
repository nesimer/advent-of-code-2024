# advent-of-code-2024

All my implementations of [Advent of Code days 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024):

- [1/12](days/1/mod.ts) - ⭐⭐ - compute distance and similarity between two number lists
- [2/12](days/2/mod.ts) - ⭐⭐ - count safe or dampened safe report in a list of them (a report is a number list)
- [3/12](days/3/mod.ts) - ⭐⭐ - parse a text file to extract well-formatted multiplication operations and sum their results (can have do/don't rules)
- [4/12](days/4/mod.ts) - ⭐⭐ - search XMAS word in file in multiple direction and different shape
- [5/12](days/5/mod.ts) - ⭐⭐ - extract rules and orders from input and sums the middle elements of valid orders and fixed orders
- [6/12](days/6/mod.ts)  - ⭐⭐ - count visited cells of patrol guard in a grid and count total endless loop schema if add new obstruction on guard patrol
- [7/12](days/7/mod.ts)  - ⭐⭐ - check valid equation using left-right operators combination (1. ["+", "\*"] 2. ["+", "*", "||"])
- [8/12](days/8/mod.ts)  - ⭐⭐ - count total of valid distinct antinodes from grid that contains different frequencies antennas
- [9/12](days/9/mod.ts)  - ⭐⭐ - arrange a disk map to remove gaps between file blocks, and computes the checksum of the arranged disk map
- [10/12](days/10/mod.ts)  - ⭐⭐ - count total of hiking trails (non-distincts and distincts) from trailheads
- [11/12](days/11/mod.ts)  - ⭐⭐ - count generated stones after 25 blinks and after 75 blinks
- [12/12](days/12/mod.ts)  - ⭐⭐ - compute prices of fencing regions (sum of area \* perimeter / sum of area \* sides)
- [13/12](days/13/mod.ts)  - ⭐⭐ - calculate minimal possible cost on each claw machines from input
